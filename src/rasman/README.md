Rasman (Raspberry Pi Manager) is an open-source software that lets you control the 
BioMonstaaar algae bioreactor, automatically upload your bioreactor's data to the 
BioMonstaar portal and share data with others.

See the [RasmanUserGuide](docs/RasmanUserGuide.md) for more info.   

In time, we will add more documents under the docs/ folder.
